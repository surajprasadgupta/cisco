# Overview

Django REST framework is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.

Some reasons you might want to use REST framework:

* The [Web browsable API][sandbox] is a huge usability win for your developers.
* Authentication policies including optional packages for JWT .
* Serialization that supports both ORM and non-ORM data sources.
* Customizable all the way down - just use regular function-based views if you don't need the more powerful features.
* Extensive documentation, and great community support.

There is a live example API for testing purposes, [available here][sandbox].
